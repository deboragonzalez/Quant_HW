### Work through the Logic lesson, and the first half of the Functions lesson (go to 50%). Then answer the following questions. Show work (copy the R commands) for each question that requires output from R.

1.	List all of the logical operators you learned in the “Logic” section and define each.


2.	Find the opposite of whether 3 == 4.


3.	Evaluate !(7 > 6) & (7==7) | (6==5)


4.	Which is evaluated first for each pair below?

  a.	&  |
  b.	&&  |
  c.	&& ||
  d.	& ||

5.	What does the xor() function do?


6.	Tell R to tell you the date.


7.	Calculate the mean of 3 numbers using a simple R function that comes with R.


8.	Print the output of: boring_function('My first function!')


9.	Write the function my_mean from the tutorial and print your function here.


10.	After writing your function, provide the output of the following:
  
  a.	remainder(4, div = 2)

  b.	remainder(4, div = 10)
