## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

library(mosaic)
toddhotdogs <- c(22,29,18,23,19, 22, 25, 28, 19, 18)

mean(toddhotdogs)
sd(toddhotdogs)

t_test_result <- mosaic::t.test(~ toddhotdogs, mu = 22)
t_test_result
```

```{r}

mikihotdogspre <- c(32, 30, 28, 20, 22, 28, 25, 19, 19, 22)

mikihotdogspost <- c(33, 35, 37, 28, 29, 28, 29, 33, 31, 29)

mean(mikihotdogspre)
mean(mikihotdogspost)

sd(mikihotdogspre)
sd(mikihotdogspost)

t_test_paired <- t.test(mikihotdogspost, mikihotdogspre, paired = TRUE)
t_test_paired

```

d is the difference between the scores, d with the little dash is the mean of the differences.
SS -- sum of squares; easiest way to find is to multiply variance of differences and multiply by n-1
